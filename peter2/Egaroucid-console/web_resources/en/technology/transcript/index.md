## Details

You can see text files formatted like ```XXXXXXX.txt``` in each directory,  and inside it, there are 10 thousand ```f5d6``` formatted transcripts.

Since this data was generated for training Egaroucid's evaluation function, the first $N$ moves are played randomly. This number $N$ is determined by the following method.

1. Set constants $N_{min},N_{max}$
2. In each game, determine $N$ randomly. $N$ satisfies  $N_{min}\leq N \leq N_{max}$
3. Play first $N$ moves randomly, then start self-play

The details of the data for each directory are summarized below.
